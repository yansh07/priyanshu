        Hello, Priyanshu this side.
        <br />
        I&apos;m a BCA student who treats learning like survival. I work with
        Python. Theory bores me, I
        want things that actually run.
        <br /><br/>
        Outside tech, I&apos;m built on philosophy. Dostoevsky, Orwell, Kafka,
        Osho - the usual suspects for anyone who thinks too much and feels too
        deeply. I live with a mix of skepticism and curiosity; questioning
        everything, accepting nothing at face value, carving meaning out of this
        chaotic world.
        <br />
        My goals are simple but heavy: grow into something I&apos;m not ashamed
        of and one day build a quite home in the mountains with who understands
        silence as much as words.
        <br />
        I&apos;m disciplined, introverted, dangerously reflective, and stubborn
        about my dreams. I code, I learn, I write, I break things, I rebuild
        them.
        <br />
        And no matter what the worlds demands. I walk my own way - one line of
        code, one idea, one sunrise at a time.
      </p>
    </div>
